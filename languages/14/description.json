	"description": "CLIPS is a public domain software tool for building expert systems. The name is an acronym for \"C Language Integrated Production System.\" The first versions of CLIPS were developed starting in 1985 at NASA-Johnson Space Center (as an alternative for existing system ART*Inference) until the mid-1990s when the development group's responsibilities ceased to focus on expert system technology. The original name of the project was NASA's AI Language (NAIL).",
