	"description": "D (or Dlang) is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright of Digital Mars and released in 2001. Bright was joined in the design and development effort in 2007 by Andrei Alexandrescu. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is a distinct language, having redesigned some core C++ features while also sharing characteristics from other languages, notably Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.",
